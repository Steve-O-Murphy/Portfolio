# Steve Murphy Documentation Portfolio

I put much effort my documentation, following technical writer best practices and using crisp, clear language. The professional results are always worth the effort. I always conduct subject matter expert and peer reviews on my content.

## Senior Technical Writer at Edgio, Tempe, Arizona

I authored the following content using MadCap Flare. I invoked each API to ensure information accuracy. 

### API documentation

* [Video Content API Developers Reference](https://support.limelight.com/public/video/en/Default.htm#Video/Video%20-%20Platform/Guide/content_api.htm)

    The content API allows customers to perform many actions, such as uploading media and creating playlists. I inherited this information and contributed large amounts of content. I transformed the format to a standard structure with tables and drop-down arrows.

    Actual API reference information begins at [API Requests - Query](https://support.limelight.com/public/video/en/Default.htm#Video/Video%20-%20Platform/Guide/content_api.htm#3.0)

* [Video Analytics API Developers Reference](https://support.limelight.com/public/video/en/Default.htm#Video/Video%20-%20Platform/Guide/analytics_api.htm)

    The Analytics API provides insight into viewership metrics, such as the total number of times a video was viewed. I wrote this information from scratch.

* [Edgio Storage API Reference](https://support.limelight.com/public/en/Default.htm#Storage/API%20Reference%20Guide/API%20Reference_Public.htm)

    The Edgio Storage API allows developers to perform actions such as uploading content to the Cloud Storage platform. I transformed this information from a 15-page Word document to beautiful HTML and PDF format with syntax highlighting and code samples.

### SDK documentation

I authored the following SDKs, starting from very rough drafts from developers. 

* [Realtime Streaming Android SDK Quick Start](https://support.limelight.com/public/en/Default.htm#Video/Limelight%20Realtime%20Streaming%20v2/RTS%20SDK%20-%20Android.htm)

    To ensure accuracy, I installed and configured Android Studio, then tested and enhanced instructions accordingly.

* [Realtime Streaming HTML SDK Quick Start](https://support.limelight.com/public/en/Default.htm#Video/Limelight%20Realtime%20Streaming%20v2/RTS%20SDK%20-%20HTML.htm)

    I was not able to test the information, but I applied tech writer best practices and transformed the information into excellent content.

### User guide

[Control Portal User Guide](https://support.limelight.com/public/en/Content/Control/Control%20Portal%20-%20User%20Guide/User%20Guide%20Pages/Control%20Portal%20User%20Guide.htm?tocpath=Control%7CUser%20Guide%7C_____0)

Upon inheriting this document, I converted it from narrative format to task-based and enhanced it by adding screenshots. I created a standard outline for the Reports section, which made it easy to add new report capabilities.

### Frequently Asked Questions

I created and maintained [Frequently Asked Questions](https://support.limelight.com/public/en/Default.htm#Video/Video%20-%20Platform/FAQ/FAQs.htm?TocPath=Video%257C_____3) (FAQs) for the Video Platform.

### Knowledge article

I authored this article using markdown. I did extensive research and invoked GraphQL queries to understand the subject matter and clearly document it.
