I authored the following content using MadCap Flare. I invoked each API to ensure information accuracy. 

### API documentation

* Video Content API Developers Reference

    The content API allows customers to perform many actions, such as uploading media and creating playlists. I inherited this information and contributed large amounts of content. I transformed the format to a standard structure with tables and drop-down arrows.

* Video Analytics API Developers Reference

    The Analytics API provides insight into viewership metrics, such as the total number of times a video was viewed. I wrote this information from scratch.

* Edgio Storage API Reference 

    The Edgio Storage API allows developers to perform actions such as uploading content to the Cloud Storage platform. I transformed this information from a 15-page Word document to beautiful HTML and PDF format with syntax highlighting and code samples.

### SDK documentation

I authored the following SDKs documents, starting from very rough drafts from developers. 

* Realtime Streaming Android SDK Quick Start

    To ensure accuracy, I installed and configured Android Studio, then tested and enhanced instructions accordingly.

* Realtime Streaming HTML SDK Quick Start

    I was not able to test the information, but I applied tech writer best practices and transformed the information into excellent content.

### User guide

Control Portal User Guide

Upon inheriting this document, I converted it from narrative format to task-based and enhanced it by adding screenshots. I created a standard outline for the Reports section, which made it easy to add new report capabilities.

### GraphQL Knowledge article

I authored the article using markdown. I did extensive research and invoked GraphQL queries to understand the subject matter and clearly document it.
