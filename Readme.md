The Analytics API provides insight into viewership metrics, such as the total number of times a video was viewed. I wrote this information from scratch.

•	Realtime Streaming Android SDK Quick Start
To ensure accuracy, I installed and configured Android Studio, then tested and enhanced instructions accordingly.
