# Steve Murphy Documentation Portfolio

I put much effort my documentation, following technical writer best practices and using crisp, clear language. The professional results are always worth the effort. I always conduct subject matter expert and peer reviews on my content.

## SiriusXM

In my role as technical writer I:

* Create and maintain REST API documentation for the in-vehicle radio client. I create the documentation by hand-coding JSON in an internal SiriusXM format.

* Participate in developer-level documentation projects that require research in the extensive code base, then author the needed content in Confluence pages. 

* Assist other teams as needed, usually doing research in the code base so the teams can focus on development work.

## Netspend

I created and maintained documentation for Netspend's REST API. I also contributed to the style guide and participated in group documentation efforts. My co-workers were located in India so in essence we provided round-the-clock documentation support. 

I made large contributions to the Netspend developer documentation.

I dedicated much time to editing the [API YAML Specification](https://docs.developer.netspend.com/openapi/64b827157f32310023e502f6), ensuring consistent descriptions and enforcing writing best practices.


## Steyer Content 

I authored Amazon OpenSearch API documentation using markdown following a prescribed content outline. We used the Jekyll static site generator.

I invoked each API to ensure information accuracy. I pushed the content to the OpenSearch documentation GitHub repository. Amazon editors reviewed the content and suggested changes, which I implemented.

## Edgio

**Note:** In November 2024, Edgio declared bankruptcy under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The following documents, formerly accessible on Edgio's public web site, are available only on this GitHub page except where noted.

I authored the following content using MadCap Flare. I invoked each API to ensure information accuracy. 

### API documentation

* Video Content API Developers Reference

    The content API allows customers to perform many actions, such as uploading media and creating playlists. I inherited this information and contributed large amounts of content. 

    **Note:** I do not have a copy of this document.

* Video Analytics API Developers Reference

    The Analytics API provides insight into viewership metrics, such as the total number of times a video was viewed. I wrote this information from scratch. 

* Storage API Reference Guide

    The Storage API allows developers to perform actions such as uploading content to the Cloud Storage platform. I transformed this information from a 15-page Word document to beautiful HTML and PDF format with syntax highlighting and code samples. Except where noted, PDFs are available in the file list at the top of this page.

### SDK documentation

I authored the following SDKs documents, starting from very rough drafts from developers.

**Note:** I do not have copies of these documents.

* Realtime Streaming Android SDK Quick Start

    To ensure accuracy, I installed and configured Android Studio, then tested and enhanced instructions accordingly.

* Realtime Streaming HTML SDK Quick Start

    I was not able to test the information, but I applied tech writer best practices and transformed the information into excellent content.

### User guide

Control User Guide

Upon inheriting this document, I converted it from narrative format to task-based instructions and enhanced it by adding screenshots. I created a standard outline for the Reports section, which made it easy to add new report capabilities.  

### GraphQL Knowledge article

I authored the article using markdown. I did extensive research and invoked GraphQL queries to understand the subject matter and clearly document it.
