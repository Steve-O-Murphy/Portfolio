# Steve Murphy Documentation Portfolio

I put much effort my documentation, following technical writer best practices and using crisp, clear language. The professional results are always worth the effort. I always conduct subject matter expert and peer reviews on my content.

## SiriusXM
In my role as technical writer I:

* Create and maintain REST API documentation for the radio client. I create the documentation by hand-coding JSON in a pre-determined format.

* Participate in developer-level documentation tasks that require research in the extensive code base and writing up content in our Confluence pages. 

* Assist other teams as needed, usually doing research in the code base so the teams can focus on development work.

## Netspend
I created and maintained documentation for Netspend's REST API. I also contributed to the style guide and participated in group documentation efforts. My co-workers were located in India so in essence we provided round-the-clock documentation support.

## Steyer Content 

I authored Amazon OpenSearch API documentation using markdown following a prescribed content outline. We used the Jekyll static site generator.

I invoked each API to ensure information accuracy. I pushed the content to the OpenSearch documentation GitHub repository. Amazon editors reviewed the content and suggested changes, which I implemented.

## Edgio

**Note:** In November 2024, Edgio declared bankruptcy under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Except where noted, the following documents, formerly accessible to the public, are no longer available so no links are provided.

I authored the following content using MadCap Flare. I invoked each API to ensure information accuracy. 

### API documentation

* Video Content API Developers Reference

    The content API allows customers to perform many actions, such as uploading media and creating playlists. I inherited this information and contributed large amounts of content. I transformed the format to a standard structure with tables and drop-down arrows.

* Video Analytics API Developers Reference

    The Analytics API provides insight into viewership metrics, such as the total number of times a video was viewed. I wrote this information from scratch. A PDF is available in the file list at the top of this page.

* Storage API Reference Guide

    The Storage API allows developers to perform actions such as uploading content to the Cloud Storage platform. I transformed this information from a 15-page Word document to beautiful HTML and PDF format with syntax highlighting and code samples.  A PDF is available in the file list at the top of this page.

### SDK documentation

I authored the following SDKs documents, starting from very rough drafts from developers. 

* Realtime Streaming Android SDK Quick Start

    To ensure accuracy, I installed and configured Android Studio, then tested and enhanced instructions accordingly.

* Realtime Streaming HTML SDK Quick Start

    I was not able to test the information, but I applied tech writer best practices and transformed the information into excellent content.

### User guide

Control User Guide

Upon inheriting this document, I converted it from narrative format to task-based instructions and enhanced it by adding screenshots. I created a standard outline for the Reports section, which made it easy to add new report capabilities.  A PDF is available in the file list at the top of this page.

### GraphQL Knowledge article

I authored the article using markdown. I did extensive research and invoked GraphQL queries to understand the subject matter and clearly document it. A PDF is available in the file list at the top of this page.
